# Encryption App

Encryption App is a GUI implemented with Python that uses the Caesar Cipher to encrypt and decrypt text with a given key value. The actual encryption app includes the Caesar Cipher as well as the AES Cipher and a password generator. 


## Installation

To use the app just clone this repo and run the code in your IDE of preference. Module required is **Crypto.Cipher** to make use of the AES Cipher.

## Usage
The _gui_app.py_ file contains the code to run the application which imports the Caesar Cipher functions from the _encrypt_app.py_ file you need to input a key value between 1-26 and text you choose to encrypt/decrypt.

The code in _encrypt_app.py_ contains the Caesar Cipher functions, the **AES Cipher** which encrypts/decrypts text files in your directory. Both ciphers can be used by running the code in your terminal and following the instructions given.
